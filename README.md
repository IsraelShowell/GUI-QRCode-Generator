This is a Python Script I made that allows a user to type in or paste a URL in a field, and then with a push of a button, can generate a QR code that can be printed out and scanned!

# Current Features as of V-1.00:
- A user is able to paste or type in a URL link in a text field and generate a QR code for that link relative to where the Python script is.
